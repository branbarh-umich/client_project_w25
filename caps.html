          community. The work of CAPS spans multiple critical areas: clinical
          service delivery, prevention and education, mental health wellness,
          research and data work, and training the next generation of mental
          health professionals.

            means CAPS counselors are integrated into various campus
            communities. This model allows for more targeted, contextualized
            support that understands the specific challenges of different
            student groups.
